# Current Task: Logging System and Accessibility Improvements

## Completed Objectives
1. Added comprehensive logging system
2. Enhanced accessibility handling with automatic monitoring
3. Added logs window with filtering and search
4. Replaced all print statements with structured logging

## Changes Made

1. Added LoggerService:
   - Centralized logging with timestamps
   - Log categorization (info/warning/error)
   - Log persistence across window sessions
   - Export and copy functionality
   - Search and filtering capabilities

2. Added Log Window:
   - Created LogView with filtering and search
   - Added "Show Logs" menu item
   - Implemented auto-scrolling
   - Added copy and clear functions
   - Color-coded log types

3. Enhanced Accessibility Handling:
   - Continuous permission monitoring with timer
   - Automatic permission re-check every 2 seconds
   - Instant hotkey registration upon permission grant
   - Improved permission request UI
   - Direct link to System Settings
   - Better feedback in logs
   - Automatic recovery after permissions granted

4. Updated Core Services:
   - Replaced print() with LoggerService.log()
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Enhanced debugging information
   - Added operation timestamps
   - Improved error context

## Implementation Details
1. LoggerService Structure:
   - Singleton instance for app-wide logging
   - Thread-safe log storage
   - Timestamped entries
   - Log type categorization

2. UI Components:
   - Log window with search and filters
